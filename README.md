# Everybody Can Cook with React Native

This repository contains all of the demos from my talk at App.js Conf 2025: [Everybody can Cook with React Native](https://youtu.be/kaUamUQXeo0).

> Note: Some of these demos are extracted from [Demos](https://reactiive.io/demos), which is a collection of animations I've built over the past two years and I update weekly. Feel free to check it out if you're interested in more animations.

## Resources that helped me

While preparing for this talk, I dove deep into animation theory. Here are some resources that shaped my understanding:

- [animations.dev](https://animations.dev) by Emil Kowalski - An incredible course on animations
- [The Basics of Easing](https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing) by Paul Lewis
- [The physics behind spring animations](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/the-physics-behind-spring-animations/) by Maxime Heckel
- [Animate with Springs - WWDC 2023](https://youtu.be/HaZ2jw9rx9M) by Jacob Xiao
- [React Native Skia tutorials](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/tutorials/)

## Motion Tool

During the talk, I presented [motion.reactiive.io](https://motion.reactiive.io), a tool I created to approximate timing animations with spring animations and vice versa. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/enzomanuelmangano/motion.reactiive.io).
