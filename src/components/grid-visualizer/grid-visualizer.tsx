// The whole idea of this component is to display a grid of squares.
// A text is going to be passed to the grid, but it won't be displayed as a regular text.
// The text will be converted to a path, and all the squares that are contained in the path
// will be highlighted with a different color and remapped to a different position (depending on the scaleFactor).

// To achieve this, we need to:
// - Create a path from the text
// - Create a grid of squares
// - Check if each square is contained in the path (activeRects)
// - Animate the squares that are contained in the path (activeProgress)
// - Animate the colors of the squares that are contained in the path (colors)
// - Animate the position of the squares that are contained in the path (transforms)

// Since the component can support a ton of squares, we can't use
// neither regular Animated.Views nor regular Skia Rects.
// We need to use the Atlas API from Skia which supports rendering a lot of sprites with the same texture.

// From the [Skia docs](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/shapes/atlas/)
// The Atlas component is used for efficient rendering of multiple instances of the same texture or image.
// It is especially useful for drawing a very large number of similar objects, like sprites, with varying transformations.

// The Atlas API is a bit low-level, but it's super powerful.
// Keep in mind that (in my opinion) without Atlas, you just can't make this animation with a decent performance :)
